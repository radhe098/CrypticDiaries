$Date -> 9/4/24
Yesterday night was like very different , I don't know what was happening. I think I was lost and unable to make decisions.{had a bit stress for CAP project completion }😶
I woke up made some work on project, thought about aai's command for taking bath today and bought new soap [this is my 4th soap (medimex)] and completed it. then went for lunch {late}😪. but I didn't felt that much about that.
after that same crawling into laptop [tired after a time ] but what can I do [how much times do I sleep 😣] okay ,
got another thing to do started watching "I Want To Eat Your Pancreas" 😄. I don't think I wont be doing many things due to my ugliness.[ this is truth and I've to claim it]. 
while watching movie I found many similarities with "sakura"; but whenever I like any movie and I am in that flow I thinks about present and stops daydreaming. the same thing happened this time so what should I do 🦝 
I think I have to manage work and sort it by weightage ;)
So there's time remained too. 
{
"Conclusion" : "movie told me to live in present"
"Learning" : "I should be careful about my back and neck posture"
}
 Tomorrow will complete submission of pwp & eti 😃
