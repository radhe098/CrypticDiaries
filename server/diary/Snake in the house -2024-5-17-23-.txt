Room madhye gusla saap 🐍 {late again for writing}

today 15-05 tomorrow is my python exam and i was just trying to learn and focus ,
at noon time I was ready to go for sleep but I remembered my fathers saying "alas karuni lagty radhe" so I just skipped that thought and began to read with chatGPT with listening songs. at nearly 3 pm while reading just felt like a snake is coming from door in hurry 😨. 
it was in so speed that I didn't see its head only its body was visible. so it was just 1 meter away from me when i saw it ( I was seeing snake for first time that much near🤯). I don't know how I managed to move that quick by besiding laptop, mouse, headphone, phone. we escaped from room [lucky and me]  I was shirtless 😝 also. after 10 sec snake came out of room and went into outside hole. 🐍 his length was almost 5ft.  it all happened within 30-45 sec.
I was relax until I started to tell story to others then my fear came out. 😫 is should be🤐 
now done with snake I'm shifted to another room. 
read something and slept and woke up for another day of exam

16-05
Paper was okay but still faced difficulties in many parts, but main problem that I got pressure from my ass for shit. You may dont know how badly I performed because of this , mayur had bought paper they were happy about their decision . nobody gave a fuck about my snake's encounter.
okay i learnt that thing will remember that for next time.
after completing paper My interview was scheduled for 2-5 pm slot. made mistake here also of "not checking background".
ok done .
at night called to mom ,
went for meditation and just made another sitting asked my doubt to that bhantaji he told me which was required " " lifesaver 😯. 
then it done 😂 this is not my life like this easy
another problem came that was of electricity. I slept in mosquitoes for a night because obviously we can't keep doors open for a night 🐍. 

These were my recent two days.
now today 17-05

saw lovebites given by mosquitoes  throughout the night and just completed daily stuff at 1 in the noon light came back.
was about to masterbate ; started drawing  made my first sketch today which was mine yes its odd but okay. slept and did nothing then same eat meditate sleep

fine 
we are moving to the "tomorrow "

{ "conclusion" : " conclusions are many but at that point it was my conclusion  😁  but still am here "
