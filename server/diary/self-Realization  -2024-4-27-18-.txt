$Date: 27/04/24
After that loss of flow hackathon I did nothing for 3 days after that I moved on that topic and made myself to focus more on exams which is my final sem .
So for just checking out cutoffs I viewed cap data of 23-24. I got realised my biggest mistake of last sem for not studying and getting lower marks. 
the cutoff after reservation for cse is above 80 and i am in shock. for agrigate to make myself above 80 I will have to get above 90% and its still toughbecause ihavent studied till now just starting from now. can i get . so I set boundries for subjects
MAD-65/70
Python- 70/70
PHP - 70/70
EST-   70/70
Managemant -70/70
so that i can get above 90 but its way hard today is 27 and I did basics of MAD hardly get passed out on that and havent done anything of other subjects 
i am upset of my all past mistake , i think geting into diploma was my biggest mistake ever. I am like what I can do now.
okay I tried to cry but i couldn't.  from today is only two weeks left, lets see what i can do.
Now trying to focus on exams but I am unable to do that. sometimes I feels like I did nothing for my family. and after this lower percentage I will not able to join for goood collage or government collage. 
I ruined all my collage-life and just masterubated mentally and physically.

{ 
"conclusion" : " I am lost, I am loser  just used to flex and talk did nothing for future I am like my father did nothing. all the ideas are just worthless if i get below 90%"
}
Saving this note betting on myself that I can get 90% I'll prove my destiny wrong. :|
