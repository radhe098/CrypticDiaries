$Date: 5-4-24
So day was fine untill 3 pm , because untill i had completed all microprojects and just after it there was a turning point.
I just opened app SIVI App then started to talk to strangers, after a while I got a marathi guy "telling about his life problems " and his mistake of early marriage leading more critical sinarios into his life.
after many matches I matched with a foreigner man her voice was too melodious her accent, her words I was telling her my insta id and my network got turned off. ðŸ˜‘ I was very exicited that time but nvm its okay, I accepted it. 
then I tried much but nobody got that good then I slept for a while .
after waking up again started with app and eventually I encountered with a bengali auntie she was okay but started to give me lessons btw her english was fine, after that I didnt get proper match so I went for dinner.
## here after I started again , but but but this is what which made my day {Manas} this guy was awesome , btw  he was nit Trichy alumni and a singer as profession and he sung multiple songs for me .his voice was much melodious {i was influenced to him at that time } ðŸ˜… , he was telling me not to simp for girls. he told me his recent experience ,
but  he was way experienced than me at all things. he shared his telegram id but im banned there ðŸ¤ª.
